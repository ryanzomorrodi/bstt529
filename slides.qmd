## Background


- Depression is a major mental health challenge among U.S. veterans.
- In 2008, Veterans Affairs [@u.s._department_of_veterans_affairs_va_2016] estimated that among veterans visiting primary care clinics
    - 1 in 3 veterans have some symptoms of depression
    - 1 in 5 have serious symptoms
    - 1 in 8 to 10 have major depression


## Potential Causes of Depression Among Veterans

## Depression Prediction with Healthcare Data

- Given the high prevalence of depression among veterans, it is import that healthcare providers pay special attention to their mental health
- A specialized prediction model for veterans may allow healthcare practitioners to identify veteran-specific characteristics that are associated with higher risk of depressive

## Data Background

::::::: columns
::::: {.column width="50%"}
- 2005 to 2018 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
- NHANES is a national representative survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which includes:
    - Health exams
    - Laboratory tests
    - Dietary interviews

## Data Background (cont.)

- The total dataset was filtered to include only veterans
- There are 3,929 samples and 490 predictors
- Special attention will be payed toward the memory issues and trouble sleeping predictors

## Bivariate Analysis

- Depression is highest amongst young and middle-aged adults
- Depression is highest amongst people of color

::::::: columns

```{r}
depression_rate <- mean(df$depression == "Depressed")

## Bivariate Analysis

- Depression is about 40% lower among married veterans
- Depression is much higher among those without a high school diploma

## Bivariate Analysis

- Obesity is most prevalent amongst middle-aged individuals

```{r}
library(ggmosaic)

df %>%
    filter(!is.na(BMI_class)) %>%
    group_by(age_class, BMI_class) %>%
    summarize(n = n()) %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(age_class), fill = BMI_class, weight = n), show.legend = FALSE) +
    theme_mosaic() +
    labs(
        x = "Age",
        y = "BMI"
    )
```

## Bivariate Analysis

- Younger veterans tend to have more education

```{r}
library(ggmosaic)

df %>%
    filter(!is.na(education_level)) %>%
    group_by(age_class, education_level) %>%
    summarize(n = n()) %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(age_class), fill = education_level, weight = n), show.legend = FALSE) +
    theme_mosaic() +
    labs(
        x = "Age",
        y = "Education"
    )
```
## Bivariate Analysis

- Within this dataset, individuals with a history of trouble sleeping are also more likely to have memory problems

```{r}
library(ggmosaic)

df %>%
    group_by(trouble_sleeping_history, memory_problems) %>%
    summarize(n = n()) %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(trouble_sleeping_history), fill = memory_problems, weight = n), show.legend = FALSE) +
    theme_mosaic() +
    labs(
        x = "History of Trouble Sleeping",
        y = "Memory Problems"
    )
```
